This release contains bug fixes on top of the existing new features of 1.4.0:

New features:
- You can now choose a custom theme and color scheme for the app's UI
- New pure black dark theme mode

Fixes:
- Average focus durations now do not include days with no activity
- Fix a critical bug that caused the app's timer state to reset to Focus whenever the app was closed from recents and then opened
- Replace the word "Reset" with "Exit" in the notification to make its purpose less ambiguous
